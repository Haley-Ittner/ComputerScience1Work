PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this project is to implement a game that uses either the console or the
dialog boxes to play. The game being played is called Craps, which involes two dice being rolled. This
specific game is designed for multiple players to play. At the beginning of the game, the player starts with a 
fixed amount of tokens, known as the player's initial "stake." To play a round of The Dice Game, the 
player must input 10 tokens. If the player has less than 10 tokens then the game is over and the player 
must quit. The game will also quit if the player decides not to give up 10 tokens to play. Once the game 
starts, the dice are rolled and the faces of the dice are summed up.  This is called the comeout roll.
The player will win 20 tokens if the sum is equal to 7 or 11. However, the round is over and no tokens 
are awarded if the sum is equal to 2, 3, or 12. If the sum is not equal to a 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12, 
then the sum of the round is called the "point" and the game continues.  The round then has a total of 3
different outcomes depending on a second sum from a second dice roll.  If the second roll is equal to 7 
then the round ends and no tokens are awarded. If the second roll is equal to the first roll sum, or the 
"point", then the player is awarded 20 tokens and the round ends.  If the second roll is not equal to 7 
or the the point, then the dice are rolled again until a 7 or the point value is achieved. This game is a
fun probability game for everyone.
